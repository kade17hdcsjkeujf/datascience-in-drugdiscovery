Drug Discovery Project
Welcome to the Drug Discovery Project! This project aims to identify potential drug candidates through computational analysis and bioinformatics techniques,
focusing on protein-ligand docking, virtual screening, and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) prediction. By using machine learning and molecular modeling tools,
this project provides a computational pipeline for early-stage drug discovery.

Overview
Drug discovery is a complex, multi-step process involving the identification of bioactive compounds, optimization for high efficacy and low toxicity, and validation. This project provides a computational framework to screen and evaluate potential small-molecule drugs for a specific protein target using bioinformatics and cheminformatics tools.

Features
Protein-Ligand Docking: Simulates the binding affinity between target proteins and ligands.
Virtual Screening: Screens a large library of compounds to identify potential drug candidates.
ADMET Prediction: Evaluates pharmacokinetic properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity.
Machine Learning for Activity Prediction: Predicts biological activity of compounds using machine learning models trained on bioactivity data.
Result Visualization: Provides data visualizations to interpret docking scores, binding interactions, and ADMET profiles.
Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: Python
Molecular Modeling Tools: AutoDock Vina, PyMOL
Virtual Screening Tools: Open Babel, RDKit
ADMET Prediction: pkCSM, SwissADME
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Databases: PubChem, ChEMBL, PDB
Project Workflow
Target Selection: Choose a protein target relevant to the disease.
Data Collection: Gather ligand libraries from chemical databases (e.g., PubChem, ChEMBL).
Molecular Docking: Use AutoDock Vina for docking simulations and scoring of potential ligands.
Virtual Screening: Screen large compound libraries to identify top-scoring candidates.
ADMET Prediction: Predict pharmacokinetic properties using pkCSM and SwissADME.
Machine Learning: Use bioactivity data to train models that predict compound efficacy.
Result Analysis and Visualization: Interpret docking scores, binding modes, and ADMET predictions.
Documentation and Reporting: Document findings and prepare a report with visualizations.

Results
Key findings and results from the docking, screening, and ADMET analysis will be saved in the results folder. You can view docking scores, visualizations of binding poses, 
and ADMET predictions in this folder. These results help identify top drug candidates for further experimental validation.
